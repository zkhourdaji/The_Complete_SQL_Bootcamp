# The_Complete_SQL_Bootcamp
This is my notes and queries for my own reference from the complete sql bootcamp on udemy.

This course uses Postgresql with pgAdmin 4.

The database used is dvdrental.tar Which is inside the repository. To restore it using pgAdmin, create a new database then right click on it and select restore.

An image of the tables and relations is also provided in this repository.
